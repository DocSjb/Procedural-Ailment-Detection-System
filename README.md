Healthcare has evolved at a rapid pace, and with
its evolution has arrived the need for an Information Technology
system able to serve the basic purposes while evolving with the
times. Procedural Ailment Detection System is a Software as a
Service (SaaS) approach to simplifying the fundamental problems
associated with digitization of healthcare to the masses. It is a
system implementing a variety of web services and resources
to enable a technological medium which allows for end users
to identify ailments, connect with hospitals, find basic medical
advice and gain a medical forum. This system is better than the
other services on offer because it utilizes a data mining approach
with respect to the datasets it has at the beginning and gains over
time, which when mapped to the interactive UI, essentially allows
for a more efficient system with a far higher cognitive ability.
